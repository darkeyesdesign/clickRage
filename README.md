# DarkEyes Design
+ A place other than my [development portfolio](https://billbunkum.github.io) to deploy applications.
+ I use ***iiixi***, a.k.a. DarkEyes Design, whenever doing commission projects for illustration, graphic design, etc.

## ButtonClick!
+ A simple, web-based, stress reliever
+ Alots 5 seconds for the aggravated/nervous user to click a huge, ass button as many times as possible.
+ Casual users need not log in or sign up, although their scores will not be persisted.

## Dependencies
+ [Compass](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass) to organize CSS/SCSS
+ [Brunch](http://brunch.io/docs/getting-started) to build site
    ++ May hold off on using Brunch as I've never used it with MEAN and there may be a more appropriate 'builder'
+ Materialize to make Responsive

## Stack
+ M.E.A.N.
